# ColorForKids
ColorForKids is a user-friendly web application built on the Next.js framework, designed to provide a searchable and genre-seperated database of coloring pages from popular children's movies. The digital assets are organized into seven unique categories for easy discovery and access. 

The application uses TailwindCSS for responsive styling and JavaScript for dynamic rendering, and is pre-configured with ESLint and Prettier for automated code formatting. ColorForKids was built using UC Riverside's Association for Computer Machinery's Next.js Hackpack for a production-ready environment.

# Ferrari-McLaren_Purchasing_Analysis
This project utilizes statistical analysis to determine what drives a consumer to choose between the elite sports car brands of Ferrari and McLaren. Using R on a dataset with 5,000 entries, I performed a logistic regression analysis to identify the purchase decision between 

I conducted simulation modeling to evaluate how features like horsepower, fuel efficiency, price, and popularity impact different customer segments, and concluded distict consumer personas: performance-driven buyers prefer Ferrari, while exclusivity-driven buyers favor McLaren. 

# Figma+Canva Posts
I specialize in building consistent design systems that bridge the gap between aesthetics and accessibility. Working with organizations like UCR's South Asian Federation and UCLA SWE, I’ve engineered component libraries and visual hierarchies from the ground up. My focus is on creating accessible UI/UX designs that drive engagement across social media and web platforms.

# Prediction-ML-Project
This project explores passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning models, and emphasizes statistical interpretability and reasoning. Through Python and scikit-learn, I implemented a logistic regression model and a decision tree to analyze the influence of linear and nonlinear modeling in predictions. 

To understand the model behavior, I created a grid of sample passengers to identify cases where the models disagreed. The project showcases bias-variance tradeoffs, feature interactions, and threshold effects dependent on the model used.

# Task_Scheduler
Through C++, Git, and GoogleTest, I collaborated in a team of four to implement a task manager, where users can input task data (titles, priority levels, due date, etc.) and the tasks will be displayed in the terminal, sorted based on priority, and includes a progress bar of a task's completion. 

I applied Object-Orientated design patterns to ensure code maintainability, and subsequently developed a comprehensive suite of unit tests using the GoogleTest framework to ensure 100% logic coverage and system stability. My team and I managed the full software development life cycle using GitHub for version control and easy collaboration.

# Great White Shark Population Life-Stage Modeling
This project investigates the population stability of Great White Sharks using a mathematical life-stage framework. I developed a stage-structured Lefkovitch Matrix model to simulate the long-term population distribution of female Great White Sharks across juvenile, mature, and adult stages. 

Additionally, I conducted numerical simulations to determine the population’s steady-state behavior, identifying a critical sensitivity to juvenile survival rates over birth rates.

# What Predicts Bouncing Back From Mental Health Struggles
This research project utilizes statistical analysis to identify the key factors that predict an individual's ability to "bounce back" from mental health struggles. I conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to test the impact of social and emotional variables on mental health outcomes.

My team and I identified that positive affect serves as the strongest predictor of resilience, showing a significant correlation with lower mental health struggle scores. 

# NYC_Flight_Delays_Analysis
This project was a data-driven exploration of flight patterns and delays across New York City’s three major airports using the "nycflights13" dataset. I engineered distribution plots and correlation scatterplots to identify non-linear relationships between weather variables and delay times. 

My team and I conducted Kruskal-Wallis and Post-hoc Dunn Tests to evaluate significant differences in delay severity across different airports and seasons. We utilized distribution plotting and statistical significance testing to prove that EWR maintains the highest overall delays, while JFK remains the most sensitive to weather fluctuations.
